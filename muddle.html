            <p><em>A Beginning, a Muddle, and an End: Proof Anyone can Prove</em> is a free, open source textbook intended for second year math majors. It's purpose is to bridge the divide between the calculative courses like calculus and those with proofs like algebra and analysis. </p>

			<h4>Instructor and student resources</h4>

			<p>I have collected slides for each chapter, note the proofs are not included on the slides, as I prefer to write the proofs on the chalk board. The slides are provided as powerpoint files to make it the easiest for the broadest audience to be able to use and edit to their hearts desire.</p>

			<h3>About the book</h3>

			<p>The text is an extended set of lecture notes from an introduction to proofs course at Saint Mary-of-the-Woods College. This course serves as an introduction to proofs course for math majors. Most students that would venture this far into the mathematics major have been enjoying these calculative classes, enjoying the comfort of an algorithm. Perhaps they were the student that loved Calculus III where they picutred three dimensional shapes and loved the visualiztation. Whatever it was I have seen far too many students then reach the more "rigorous" classes and then loose interest, changing majors or just stop enjoying mathematics. In my opinion this is just a shame! And this text tries to give students an algorithm to hold on to as they move deeper and deeper into the muddle. It is this transition from calculative to proving to why I choose instead of a combintorial based course, such a discrete mathematics, we take our trip in the the calculus student's favorite past time of numbers. So the student can rest assured that numbers are at the forefront of this course, even though we are exploring new and exciting paths where numbers may not take a leading role.</p>

			<p>This text covers: propositional logic, arguments, basic proof methods, and naive set theory, relations and functions. The basic methods of proofs includ proofs by contradiction, contrapositive, proofs by induction, and of course direct proofs. In lieu of an introductory chapter with back ground this text insteads introduces everything that is needed when it is needed. Except the only assumed prerequisite and that is <em>College Algebra</em></p>

			<p>It is not the purpose of this text to be a refrence it is meant to be read and worked through. The end of each chapter has suitable exercises. The exercises will be the first thing that the author works on for future editions and please send any suggestions!</p>
