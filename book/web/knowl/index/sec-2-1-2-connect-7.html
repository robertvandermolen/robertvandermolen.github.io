<div class="para"> The logical disjunction is often referred to as the <dfn class="terminology">inclusive or</dfn>, as it is still true when both propositions are true. In English we often assume the use of the <dfn class="terminology">exclusive or</dfn>, that is, when we use the word <em class="emphasis">or</em> we most often mean only one of two choices. For example "would you like chicken or steak." When someone says this to you, you know immediately they do not mean that you can have both chicken and steak, that is not the case for the logical disjunction.</div>
